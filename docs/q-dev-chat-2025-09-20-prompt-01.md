Generate a Kubernetes operator from guest book application that manages MVC+R (Model, View, Controller, Repository) Pattern RestAPI deployments with auto-scaling, health monitoring, and blue-green deployments. This generator using operator-sdk as standard pattern kubernetes operator

---

I'll help you generate a Kubernetes operator for managing MVC+R pattern RestAPI deployments with the features you requested. Let me start by exploring the current workspace structure and then create the operator using operator-sdk.

---

I'll create a Kubernetes operator using operator-sdk that manages MVC+R pattern RestAPI deployments. Let me generate the minimal required structure:

---

Initialize the operator project structure using operator-sdk

---

shell

---

Initialize the operator project with skip go version check

---

shell

---

Create the API for RestAPI resource

---

shell

---

Now let me check the generated structure and modify the key files to implement the MVC+R pattern with auto-scaling, health monitoring, and blue-green deployments:

---

Let me first read the current RestAPI types and controller to understand the structure:

---

Now I'll implement the MVC+R pattern RestAPI operator with the required features. Let me start by updating the RestAPI types:

---

Update RestAPI types to include MVC+R pattern specifications with auto-scaling, health monitoring, and blue-green deployment features

---

Now let me implement the controller logic with MVC+R pattern management:

---

Implement the RestAPI controller with MVC+R pattern deployment, auto-scaling, health monitoring, and blue-green deployment logic

---

Now let me create a sample RestAPI resource configuration:

---

Update the sample RestAPI configuration to demonstrate MVC+R pattern with all features

---

Update the sample RestAPI configuration to demonstrate MVC+R pattern with all features

---

Now let me create a blue-green deployment helper:

---

Create blue-green deployment helper for managing deployment strategies

---

Let me fix the import issue in the blue-green helper:

---

Fix import statement in bluegreen.go

---

Now let me create a Dockerfile for the operator:

---

Now let me create a comprehensive README for the operator:

---

Create comprehensive README documentation for the RestAPI operator

---

Now let me generate the CRDs and build the operator:

---

Generate manifests and CRDs for the operator

---

shell

---

Build the operator binary

---

shell

---

Let me fix the unused import:

---

Remove unused time import from bluegreen.go

---

Build the operator binary after fixing imports

---

shell

---

Now let me create a deployment script for easy setup:

---

Create deployment script for easy operator setup

---

Make the deployment script executable

---

shell

---

Finally, let me create a comprehensive example with multiple RestAPI instances:

---

Create comprehensive examples showing different RestAPI configurations

---

Create examples directory

---

shell

---

Create comprehensive examples showing different RestAPI configurations

---


Perfect! I've successfully generated a comprehensive Kubernetes operator for managing MVC+R pattern RestAPI deployments. Here's what has been created:

## ðŸŽ¯ **RestAPI Operator - Complete Implementation**

### **Key Features Implemented:**

1. **MVC+R Pattern Management**
   - Model, View, Controller, Repository components as separate deployments
   - Individual configuration for each component (image, port, env vars)
   - Enable/disable components independently

2. **Auto-scaling**
   - HorizontalPodAutoscaler integration
   - CPU and memory-based scaling
   - Configurable min/max replicas

3. **Health Monitoring**
   - Configurable liveness and readiness probes
   - HTTP health check endpoints
   - Customizable timeouts and thresholds

4. **Blue-Green Deployments**
   - Separate blue/green environments
   - Traffic switching capabilities
   - Automatic and manual promotion strategies

### **Generated Files:**

- **`api/v1/restapi_types.go`** - Custom Resource Definition with comprehensive specs
- **`internal/controller/restapi_controller.go`** - Main controller logic
- **`internal/controller/bluegreen.go`** - Blue-green deployment manager
- **`config/samples/apps_v1_restapi.yaml`** - Sample guestbook application
- **`examples/complete-example.yaml`** - Multiple RestAPI examples
- **`deploy.sh`** - Easy deployment script
- **`README-OPERATOR.md`** - Comprehensive documentation

### **Usage:**

```bash
# Deploy the operator
./deploy.sh

# Apply sample RestAPI
kubectl apply -f config/samples/apps_v1_restapi.yaml

# Check status
kubectl get restapi -A
kubectl get pods,svc,hpa
```

### **Sample Configuration:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps.aws.com/v1
kind: RestAPI
metadata:
  name: guestbook-restapi
spec:
  model:
    enabled: true
    image: "guestbook/model:v1.0.0"
    port: 8080
  autoScaling:
    enabled: true
    maxReplicas: 10
    targetCPUUtilization: 70
  healthCheck:
    enabled: true
    path: "/health"
  blueGreen:
    enabled: true
    strategy: "automatic"
```

The operator follows standard Kubernetes operator patterns using operator-sdk and provides a complete solution for managing MVC+R RestAPI deployments with enterprise-grade features.
